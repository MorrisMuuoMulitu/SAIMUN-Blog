      <h2>HUMAN RIGHTS</h2>
    </div>
</section>

<section>
  <div class="block">
    <p><span class="first-character sc">H</span>uman rights. The rights inherent to all human beings, regardless of race, sex, nationality, ethnicity, language, religion, or any other status. Human rights include the right to life and liberty, freedom from slavery and torture, freedom of opinion and expression, the right to work and education, and many more.  Everyone is entitled to these rights, without discrimination. These rights, like celestial constellations, guide us toward a more just and compassionate world.</p>
    <p>Originally, people had rights only because of their membership in a group, such as a family. Then, in 539 BC, Cyrus the Great, after conquering the city of Babylon, did something totally unexpected, he freed all slaves to return home. Moreover, he declared people should choose their own religion and established racial equality. The Cyrus Cylinder, a clay tablet containing his statements, is the first human rights declaration in history. Furthermore, the ancient Code of Hammurabi, etched onto stone tablets in Babylon over four millennia ago, proclaimed principles of fairness and equity. It was a precursor to the modern notion of justice.</p>
    <p class="line-break margin-top-10"></p>
    <p class="margin-top-10">Fast-forward to the Magna Carta of 1215, where English barons wrested concessions from King John. This seminal document laid the groundwork for the rule of law, asserting that even monarchs were bound by certain limits. The seeds of liberty were sown, and they would germinate across continents. The Enlightenment era, with its luminaries like Voltaire, Rousseau, and Locke, ignited intellectual wildfires. Their pens blazed with ideas that would shape the course of human rights. Locke famously wrote that man has three natural rights: life, liberty and property. These ideas seeped into the American Declaration of Independence, where Thomas Jefferson eloquently penned, “We hold these truths to be self-evident…”</p>
    <p class="margin-top-10">Across the Atlantic, the French Revolution erupted, fueled by cries for liberty, equality, and fraternity. The Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen emerged, proclaiming that all citizens were born free and equal. The world watched as the guillotine fell, severing the chains of feudalism.</p>
    <p class="margin-top-10">The twentieth century bore witness to both the horrors of war and the blossoming of hope. One of the great achievements of the United Nations was the creation of a comprehensive body of human rights law—a universal and internationally protected code to which all nations can subscribe and all people aspire. The United Nations defined a broad range of internationally accepted rights, including civil, cultural, economic, political and social rights. It also established mechanisms to promote and protect these rights and to assist states in carrying out their responsibilities. The foundations of this body of law are the Charter of the United Nations and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted by the General Assembly in 1945 and 1948, respectively.  Since then, the United Nations has gradually expanded human rights law to encompass specific standards for women, children, persons with disabilities, minorities and other vulnerable groups, who now possess rights that protect them from discrimination that had long been common in many societies.</p>
    <p class="line-break margin-top-10"></p>
    <p class="margin-top-10">Yet, the path to realization was not an easy one. The Holocaust cast a shadow so dark that it subjected the imperative to safeguard human rights into our collective psyche. The Nuremberg Trials, which were the first international war crimes tribunal in history revealed the true extent of German atrocities and held some of the most prominent Nazis accountable for their crimes, but they also underscored the need for a global commitment to prevent such atrocities. In the course of time, we encounter both progress and setbacks in the championing of human rights. The Civil Rights Movement in the United States, led by Martin Luther King Jr., shattered racial barriers. Nelson Mandela emerged from Robben Island, his spirit unbroken, to dismantle apartheid in South Africa. Malala Yousafzai, shot for advocating girls’ education, became a beacon of resilience.</p>
    <p class="margin-top-10">Yet, today’s world bears witness to new struggles. With genocides happening in different parts of the world, refugees yearning for sanctuary, journalists being silenced and marginalized communities denied their voice, the fight for LGBTQ+ rights, gender equality and environmental justice among others raging on.</p>
    <p class="margin-top-10">By championing human rights, we contribute to the creation of a global society that respects the dignity and worth of every human being, fostering a future where justice and equality prevail. As stewards of this fragile planet, we must honor our shared humanity. Human rights are not mere words, they are the oxygen that sustains our moral compass. It is up to us to champion them in our homes, schools, and legislatures.  So, dear reader, let us raise our voices, whether in prose, poetry or protest to ensure that no one is left in the shadows.</p>

    <h2>EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES: CHANGING TIMES</h2>
  </div>
</section>

<section>
  <div class="block">
    <p><span class="first-character ny">I</span>In our current age, emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence and biotechnology are reshaping the world as we know it, offering unprecedented opportunities and reaching and surpassing human capabilities in many tasks previously considered unattainable by machines. From healthcare and agriculture to environmental sustainability and beyond, the global impact of these innovations is profound and far-reaching.</p>
    <p class="line-break margin-top-10"></p>
    <p class="margin-top-10">In 2001, a perspective article published in IEEE Computer titled “Artificial Consciousness: Mission Impossible?” by Buttazzo supported a line of thought aimed at showing that there are no conceptual obstacles to the development of conscious machines, observing that all the criticisms raised over the years to undermine this possibility can easily be disassembled with logical reasoning and scientific evidence. Artificial Intelligence, often abbreviated as AI, refers to the development of computer systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. At its core, artificial intelligence mimics human cognition, processing vast amounts of data to recognize patterns, make decisions, and learn from experience. For example, generative AI tools such as ChatGPT are systems designed to produce something new based on its previous experience.</p>
    <p class="margin-top-10">There are three types of AI (Based on Capabilities):</p>
    <p class="margin-top-10"><strong>•	Narrow or Weak AI:</strong> This type of AI is designed to perform a specific task, such as playing chess or recognizing faces. Narrow AI is the most common type of AI today.</p>
    <p class="margin-top-10"><strong>•	General or Strong AI:</strong> This type of AI is designed to perform any intellectual task that a human can do. General AI is still a theoretical concept and has not yet been achieved.</p>
    <p class="margin-top-10"><strong>•	Super AI:</strong> This type of AI is hypothetical and refers to an AI system that is much more intelligent than humans and can surpass human capabilities in every aspect.</p>
    <p class="line-break margin-top-10"></p>
    <p class="margin-top-10">One of the most significant global impacts of AI lies in automation. AI-driven automation is transforming industries by streamlining processes, increasing efficiency, and reducing costs. While this has led to concerns about job displacement, it has also created new opportunities for upskilling and reskilling the workforce by creation of jobs that did not exist in the past such as video game developer, app developer, drone operator, 3D printer technician, social media manager, web designer, Youtuber, blogger, or even data analysts.</p>
    <p class="margin-top-10">Furthermore, AI has revolutionized healthcare through applications like medical imaging, drug discovery, and personalized medicine. By analyzing vast amounts of data, AI algorithms can assist healthcare professionals in diagnosing diseases, predicting patient outcomes, and designing tailored treatment plans. In the realm of environmental sustainability, AI is being leveraged to optimize energy consumption, manage resources more efficiently, and mitigate the impact of climate change. From smart grids to precision agriculture, AI technologies are playing a crucial role in building a more sustainable future.</p>
    <p class="margin-top-10">Biotechnology encompasses a wide range of techniques and technologies that harness biological systems for various applications. Currently, there are more than 250 biotechnology health care products and vaccines available to patients, many for previously untreatable diseases. Millions of farmers around the world use agricultural biotechnology to increase yields, prevent damage from insects and pests and reduce farming's impact on the environment. From genetic engineering to biopharmaceuticals, biotechnology has the potential to revolutionize healthcare, agriculture, and industrial processes. For instance,  biotechnology holds promise for sustainable industrial processes, including biofuel production, bioremediation, and waste management.</p>
    <p class="line-break margin-top-10"></p>
    <p class="margin-top-10">With these emerging technologies, the convergence of AI and biotechnology can be seen to present a paradigm shift in scientific innovation. By combining AI's data analysis capabilities with biotechnology's biological insights, researchers can accelerate drug discovery, optimize agricultural practices, and unlock new frontiers in healthcare. Through the integration of AI and biotechnology, researchers are poised to address some of the most pressing challenges being faced today, from healthcare disparities to environmental degradation.</p>
    <p class="margin-top-10">However, all these do not come without their own fair share of risks and challenges. As AI continues to evolve, it is essential to address ethical and social concerns, such as bias and privacy. AI thrives on data, but at what cost? As algorithms analyze our lives, privacy erodes. Surveillance systems, once dystopian fiction, now monitor our every move. Striking a balance between security and individual rights is of importance. Equally, algorithms inherit biases from their creators and training data. AI decisions can perpetuate inequality, affecting hiring, lending, and criminal justice. These biases ought to be scrutinized and strive for fairness.</p>
    <p class="margin-top-10">Moreover, the global impact of AI and biotechnology raises questions about equity and access. Will these technologies worsen existing inequalities, or will they be leveraged to promote inclusive development and global equity? Addressing these challenges will require collaboration across disciplines and stakeholders to ensure that AI and biotechnology benefit society as a whole. By harnessing the power of innovation responsibly, we can ensure that these technologies contribute to a brighter, more equitable future for all.</p>
