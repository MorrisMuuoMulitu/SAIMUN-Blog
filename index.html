      <h2>HUMAN RIGHTS</h2>
    </div>
</section>

<section>
  <div class="block">
    <p><span class="first-character sc">H</span>uman rights. The rights inherent to all human beings, regardless of race, sex, nationality, ethnicity, language, religion, or any other status. Human rights include the right to life and liberty, freedom from slavery and torture, freedom of opinion and expression, the right to work and education, and many more.  Everyone is entitled to these rights, without discrimination. These rights, like celestial constellations, guide us toward a more just and compassionate world.</p>
    <p>Originally, people had rights only because of their membership in a group, such as a family. Then, in 539 BC, Cyrus the Great, after conquering the city of Babylon, did something totally unexpected, he freed all slaves to return home. Moreover, he declared people should choose their own religion and established racial equality. The Cyrus Cylinder, a clay tablet containing his statements, is the first human rights declaration in history. Furthermore, the ancient Code of Hammurabi, etched onto stone tablets in Babylon over four millennia ago, proclaimed principles of fairness and equity. It was a precursor to the modern notion of justice.</p>
    <p class="line-break margin-top-10"></p>
    <p class="margin-top-10">Fast-forward to the Magna Carta of 1215, where English barons wrested concessions from King John. This seminal document laid the groundwork for the rule of law, asserting that even monarchs were bound by certain limits. The seeds of liberty were sown, and they would germinate across continents. The Enlightenment era, with its luminaries like Voltaire, Rousseau, and Locke, ignited intellectual wildfires. Their pens blazed with ideas that would shape the course of human rights. Locke famously wrote that man has three natural rights: life, liberty and property. These ideas seeped into the American Declaration of Independence, where Thomas Jefferson eloquently penned, “We hold these truths to be self-evident…”</p>
    <p class="margin-top-10">Across the Atlantic, the French Revolution erupted, fueled by cries for liberty, equality, and fraternity. The Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen emerged, proclaiming that all citizens were born free and equal. The world watched as the guillotine fell, severing the chains of feudalism.</p>
    <p class="margin-top-10">The twentieth century bore witness to both the horrors of war and the blossoming of hope. One of the great achievements of the United Nations was the creation of a comprehensive body of human rights law—a universal and internationally protected code to which all nations can subscribe and all people aspire. The United Nations defined a broad range of internationally accepted rights, including civil, cultural, economic, political and social rights. It also established mechanisms to promote and protect these rights and to assist states in carrying out their responsibilities. The foundations of this body of law are the Charter of the United Nations and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted by the General Assembly in 1945 and 1948, respectively.  Since then, the United Nations has gradually expanded human rights law to encompass specific standards for women, children, persons with disabilities, minorities and other vulnerable groups, who now possess rights that protect them from discrimination that had long been common in many societies.</p>
    <p class="line-break margin-top-10"></p>
    <p class="margin-top-10">Yet, the path to realization was not an easy one. The Holocaust cast a shadow so dark that it subjected the imperative to safeguard human rights into our collective psyche. The Nuremberg Trials, which were the first international war crimes tribunal in history revealed the true extent of German atrocities and held some of the most prominent Nazis accountable for their crimes, but they also underscored the need for a global commitment to prevent such atrocities. In the course of time, we encounter both progress and setbacks in the championing of human rights. The Civil Rights Movement in the United States, led by Martin Luther King Jr., shattered racial barriers. Nelson Mandela emerged from Robben Island, his spirit unbroken, to dismantle apartheid in South Africa. Malala Yousafzai, shot for advocating girls’ education, became a beacon of resilience.</p>
    <p class="margin-top-10">Yet, today’s world bears witness to new struggles. With genocides happening in different parts of the world, refugees yearning for sanctuary, journalists being silenced and marginalized communities denied their voice, the fight for LGBTQ+ rights, gender equality and environmental justice among others raging on.</p>
    <p class="margin-top-10">By championing human rights, we contribute to the creation of a global society that respects the dignity and worth of every human being, fostering a future where justice and equality prevail. As stewards of this fragile planet, we must honor our shared humanity. Human rights are not mere words, they are the oxygen that sustains our moral compass. It is up to us to champion them in our homes, schools, and legislatures.  So, dear reader, let us raise our voices, whether in prose, poetry or protest to ensure that no one is left in the shadows.</p>

    <p><span class="first-character ny">B</span>reaking into the New York fashion world is no easy task. But by the early 2000's, UGG Australia began to take it by storm. The evolution of UGG from a brand that made sheepskin boots, slippers, clogs and sandals for an active, outdoor lifestyle to a brand that was now being touted as a symbol of a stylish, casual and luxurious lifestyle was swift. Much of this was due to a brand repositioning effort that transformed UGG into a high-end luxury footwear maker. As a fashion brand, UGG advertisements now graced the pages of Vogue Magazine as well as other fashion books. In the mid 2000's, the desire for premium casual fashion was popping up all over the world and UGG was now perfectly aligned with this movement.</p>
    <p class="line-break margin-top-10"></p>
    <p class="margin-top-10">Fueled by celebrities from coast to coast wearing UGG boots and slippers on their downtime, an entirely new era of fashion was carved out. As a result, the desire and love for UGG increased as people wanted to go deeper into this relaxed UGG experience. UGG began offering numerous color and style variations on their sheepskin boots and slippers. Cold weather boots for women and men and leather casuals were added with great success. What started as a niche item, UGG sheepskin boots were now a must-have staple in everyone's wardrobe. More UGG collections followed, showcasing everything from knit boots to sneakers to wedges, all the while maintaining that luxurious feel UGG is known for all over the world. UGG products were now seen on runways and in fashion shoots from coast to coast. Before long, the love spread even further.</p>
